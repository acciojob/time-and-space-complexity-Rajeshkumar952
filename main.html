	<H1>Time and Space Complexity </H1>
	<P>Time Complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the given task.As a programmer, your goal should to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient.</P>
	<P><B>Space Complexity</B> is a related to the amount of memory occupied by the program.For Example,if a program takes an array of size n as input,the space complexity of the program becomes O(n). </P>
